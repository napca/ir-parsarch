A custom Persian keyboard layout focused on speed.

The project that inspired me to make this was "Workman keyboard layout" which is my main layout as of now.

The standard persian layout is not made to speedtype at all, it mainly focuses on putting characters in order (not all of them, but it is mostly like that.)

This project is NOT made proffesionally, it is just a little hobby I started,so feel free to test it and tell me your recommendations!
